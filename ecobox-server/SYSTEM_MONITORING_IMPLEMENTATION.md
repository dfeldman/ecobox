# System Monitoring Feature Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Configuration Updates (`internal/config/config.go`)
- Added `SystemCheckInterval` (default: 300s/5min) for periodic system info gathering
- Added `InitCheckInterval` (default: 3600s/1hr) for re-initialization checks
- Added `ForceReinitialization` flag to trigger re-init on startup

### 2. SystemMonitor (`internal/control/system_monitor.go`)
New comprehensive system monitoring component that:

**Initialization Checks:**
- Tests SSH connectivity
- Detects system type (Linux/Windows/Proxmox)
- Gets OS version and system ID
- Discovers network interfaces and IP addresses
- Determines system capabilities (suspend, hibernate, WoL support)
- Updates server's SystemInfo struct
- Records all actions in server action log

**Periodic System Checks:**
- Gathers real-time CPU usage
- Collects load average (1/5/15 min)
- Monitors memory usage (total/used/free/percentage)
- Tracks network usage (RX/TX bytes and MB/s rates)
- Checks disk usage
- Updates SystemInfo with current metrics
- Handles timeouts and connection failures gracefully

**Key Features:**
- Skips offline servers automatically
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Action logging for all operations
- Extensible design for future metrics collection
- Proper timeout handling for SSH operations

### 3. Monitor Integration (`internal/monitor/monitor.go`)
Updated main monitoring loop to include:
- `systemCheckLoop()` - Runs periodic system checks on online servers
- `initializationCheckLoop()` - Handles initialization and re-initialization
- Timing control to prevent excessive checking
- Proper coordination with existing ping/port monitoring

### 4. Initializer Updates (`internal/initializer/manager.go`)
- Simplified to use SystemMonitor for comprehensive initialization
- Removed basic placeholder checks in favor of real SSH-based system detection

### 5. Command Module Fixes (`internal/command/command.go`)
- Fixed all type references to use proper `models.` prefixes
- Removed unused imports
- Ensured all system info gathering functions work with proper types

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: SystemMonitor handles SSH operations, Monitor handles orchestration
2. **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if SSH fails to some servers
3. **Configurable Intervals**: Different check frequencies for different types of monitoring
4. **Comprehensive Logging**: All operations recorded with proper context
5. **Future-Ready**: Architecture supports planned metrics collection and suspend decisions

## Future Integration Points

The implementation leaves clear integration points for:

1. **Metrics Collection**: SystemMonitor can easily send data to metrics.go
2. **Suspend Decision Logic**: CPU/network data is available for suspend decisions
3. **Power Management**: System capabilities are detected and stored
4. **Dashboard Updates**: Real-time system info available via SystemInfo struct

## Error Handling

- SSH connection failures are handled gracefully
- Timeouts don't block other operations
- Offline servers are skipped automatically
- All failures are logged with context
- Operations continue even if individual servers fail

## Performance Considerations

- System checks run in separate goroutines (non-blocking)
- Configurable check intervals prevent system overload
- Timing maps prevent duplicate operations
- Online/offline status considered before attempting SSH

This implementation provides a robust foundation for the comprehensive server monitoring system requested, with proper error handling, logging, and extensibility for future enhancements.
